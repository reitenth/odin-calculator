**Time Spent:** 10-12 hrs coding, not sure on studying but pretty close to the same amount probably. 

**What I Learned:** How to keep moving forward when I got stuck and frustrated. This was the first project where the puzzle pieces didn't fall into place and it took multiple days to grasp what was not very much actual code.

**What Was Difficult:** Toughest project so far. Getting things from the 'current' screen to 'previous' took time and some help from the folks on Discord.
